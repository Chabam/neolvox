# Summary
A description of the high-level functionality and purpose of the
software for a diverse, non-specialist audience.

# Statement of need
A section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the
software and places it in the context of related work. This should
clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve, who the
target audience is, and its relation to other work.

# State of the field
A description of how this software compares to other commonly-used
packages in the research area. If related tools exist, provide a clear
“build vs. contribute” justification explaining your unique scholarly
contribution and why existing alternatives are insufficient.

# Software Design
An explanation of the trade-offs you weighed, the design/architecture
you chose, and why it matters for your research application. This
should demonstrate meaningful design thinking beyond a superficial
code structure description.

# Research Impact Statement
Evidence of realized impact (publications, external use, integrations)
or credible near-term significance (benchmarks, reproducible
materials, community-readiness signals). The evidence should be
compelling and specific, not aspirational.

# AI usage disclosure
Transparent disclosure of any use of generative AI in the software
creation, documentation, or paper authoring. If no AI tools were used,
state this explicitly. If AI tools were used, describe how they were
used and how the quality and correctness of AI-generated content was
verified.
